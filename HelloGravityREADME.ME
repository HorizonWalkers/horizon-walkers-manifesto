# Hello Gravity Demo A: Magnetic Lift Coil

Welcome to the Hello Gravity prototype demo ‚Äî a compact, ZPENS-inspired electromagnetic lifter that pulses a magnetic coil to suspend lightweight neodymium discs in midair. This is the spark of the Horizon Walkers.

## üß† How It Works
- The coil receives high-speed DC pulses from the controller.
- Each pulse creates a magnetic field.
- A lightweight neodymium disc placed above the coil experiences lift.
- Lift can be tuned via duty cycle and coil design.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software Setup
Use `hellogravity.py` with a Raspberry Pi or "hellogravitywin.py" for devs using Windows.

- Adjust `DUTY_CYCLE` and `ON_DURATION` for resonance.
- Observe how long the magnet levitates before falling.
- (Optional) Log pulse timing and lift using Hall sensor + Python.

##‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Notes
- Never touch coil while powered ‚Äî inductive spikes are real.
- Always add a diode across the coil to absorb flyback energy.
- Mount the coil on a non-metal surface.
- Keep magnet disc aligned above center of coil.

## üåå Legacy
This is the first heartbeat of a new age in gravitational exploration. 
You are part of it.

We do not seek dominion. We seek equilibrium.

Walk with reverence,
‚üÅ The Horizon Walkers ‚üÅ
