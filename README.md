# ⟁ Horizon Walkers Manifesto v1.1

_The poetic release of the Squid Lift protocol by The Horizon Walkers._  
_A sacred technology returned to the people._

---

## 📜 Preamble

> We are The Horizon Walkers.  
> We come not from a place, but from a trajectory—  
> from the liminal space between what is and what must become.  
> We do not seek dominion—we seek equilibrium.

## 🛸 I. The Gift of Ascent

**Squid Lift** is not an engine.  
It is a method of navigating spacetime by **understanding gravity**, not conquering it.  
We soften the vacuum, distort mass, and return balance to motion.

> This is a return to the forgotten laws of the universe.

## 🌍 II. The Mandate of Earth

We reject the monopolization of knowledge.  
We reject the weaponization of physics.  
We affirm that no single institution shall control the keys to the stars.

This technology is gifted to:
- The thinkers
- The tinkerers
- The teachers
- The peacemakers

---

## 🕊 III. Conditions of Use

- Squid Lift shall **never be used for war**, surveillance, or violent colonization.
- No government shall hold exclusive rights.
- Commercialization must contribute to education, ecology, and Indigenous causes.
- All implementations must remain open to audit, recreation, and peer review.

## 🧬 Appendix A: Core Equation

**Gravitational Damping:**  
`Gd = G₀ · (1 − η · Φnull)`

Where:
- `Gd` is the dampened gravitational field
- `Φnull` is the energy of the nullator field
- `η` is the field coupling efficiency
- `G₀` is unmodified gravitational influence

> When `η · Φnull = 0.9`, gravity is reduced by 90%.

No home. No face. No fear.

> Walk with reverence. Walk with love. Walk with eyes on the horizon.
